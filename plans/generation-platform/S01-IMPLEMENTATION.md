# S01 implementation record

The authoritative design is [PR #4098](https://github.com/datamodel-code-generator/datamodel-code-generator/pull/4098), plan commit `4faddb35e6f5fd73ec79fef7f10216183d3bc9c8`.
The implementation starts at main `4f96e22ea403a66faae96f3949d41dd61fc1186f`, identical to the pinned baseline; there are no intervening integration-point changes.
The planning PR remains separate and unmerged. This stack implements S01 only and exposes no new public generation target or scope.

## S01-1: comparison and observation

The existing public API signatures, generated snapshots, architecture/store checks, retry tests, remote-lock tests, and startup/generation benchmarks remain the primary oracles.
The additional end-to-end observation uses real generation across all five backends with inheritance, request/response variants, root collapse, and reuse.
It records generated file inventory and SHA256 of complete bytes, actual copy/ref/validation/render call counts, phase order, return value, new target imports, and weak-reference parser retention after collection.
Input mutation uses the existing assertion helper. Timestamps are explicitly disabled and formatters are explicitly empty; no output normalization is used before hashing.
The snapshots were established before product changes. Existing snapshots and API baselines are unchanged.

Initial verification: `pytest tests/main/test_generation_observation.py tests/main/test_public_api_signature_baseline.py tests/main/test_generation_determinism.py tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py tests/parser/test_generation_store_usage.py -q`: 80 passed.
Environment: CPython 3.13.2, macOS, dependencies installed from `uv.lock` using `uv sync --frozen --all-extras --group test --group fix --python 3.13`.

Performance procedure: existing startup cases and generation fixtures, independent processes, equal AB/BA ordering, fixed seed 4098, 30 A/A pairs and 60 A/B pairs per case, warmup before measurement, 99% bootstrap interval and two-sided sign test at 0.01.
The temporary measurement runner and raw results are outside the repository under `/tmp/dcg-s01-evidence`.
Measurements, mutation negative controls, cumulative coverage, independent PR review, and CI are pending; this record does not claim those gates passed.

## S01-2: bounded factories and copies

Added class-level store/resolver factories and three non-function partial copy callables, preserving original free helpers and their module exports. The same recursive helpers execute once with unchanged arguments. No store/model/reference fields, observers, backend classes, or runtime dependencies were added.
Extracted the existing dotted result-path expansion unchanged and retained dynamic dispatch to the existing name-mangled classmethod through a property.
A real parser/store/resolver consumer exercises constructor selection, registered/unregistered field copies, inherited copies, cross-module type copies, two-stage snooper decoration, and an operation callback replaced during traversal. Guarded methods remain inherited on the undecorated consumer.

Validation: 321 tests passed across observations, integration consumers, parser/store regressions, public API signatures, and assertion-helper enforcement. Architecture/store checkers, Ruff, and ty passed.
Performance: 30 A/A and 60 A/B pairs completed for 11 cases (six existing startup cases plus small/large/reference/multiple-module/builtin-format generation fixtures). No wall/CPU case met all predeclared regression conditions. This is not proof of zero overhead: builtin-format wall-time CI excluded zero but the sign test was 0.0135, and A/A multi-module RSS had directional drift. Memory and borderline timing conclusions remain inconclusive pending repeated cumulative measurements. Initial failed startup measurement was caused by an absent generated `_version.py` in the baseline checkout; both baselines were then given the identical generated version module before restarting all pairs.
